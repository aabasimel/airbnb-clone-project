# airbnb-clone-project
This project is a clone of **Airbnb**, built to practice and demonstrate backend web development skills.   The main objective is to replicate core features of Airbnb such as user authentication, property management, booking system, data optimization and reviews, while gaining hands-on experience with modern web technologies. 

## üéØ Goals
- Design and implement a scalable **backend system** using Django and Django REST Framework.  
- Practice **API development** (REST + GraphQL).  
- Integrate **PostgreSQL** for reliable data management.  
- Implement **asynchronous task handling** with Celery and Redis.  
- Learn containerization with **Docker** for smooth deployment.  
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** for automated testing and deployment.

- ## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
- **Django**: High-level Python web framework for building the backend and RESTful API.  
- **Django REST Framework**: Tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured data storage.  
- **GraphQL**: Flexible and efficient data querying.  
- **Celery**: Task queue for asynchronous background jobs (e.g., notifications, payments).  
- **Redis**: In-memory store for caching and session management.  
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment workflows.
